// These methods all assume you can safely take mag2() of each vector.
// Absolutely safe but slower and much uglier alternatives were 
// provided as build-time options in ZOOM SpaceVectors.
// Also, much smaller codes were provided tht assume you can square
// mag2() of each vector; but those return bad answers without warning
// when components exceed 10**90.

// IsNear, HowNear, and DeltaR are found in ThreeVector.cc</doc>
