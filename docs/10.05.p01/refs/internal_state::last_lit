<doc f='codebrowser/source/externals/zlib/include/deflate.h' l='222'>/* Size of match buffer for literals/lengths.  There are 4 reasons for
     * limiting lit_bufsize to 64K:
     *   - frequencies can be kept in 16 bit counters
     *   - if compression is not successful for the first block, all input
     *     data is still in the window so we can still emit a stored block even
     *     when input comes from standard input.  (This can also be done for
     *     all blocks if lit_bufsize is not greater than 32K.)
     *   - if compression is not successful for a file smaller than 64K, we can
     *     even emit a stored file instead of a stored block (saving 5 bytes).
     *     This is applicable only for zip (not gzip or zlib).
     *   - creating new Huffman trees less frequently may not provide fast
     *     adaptation to changes in the input data statistics. (Take for
     *     example a binary file with poorly compressible code followed by
     *     a highly compressible string table.) Smaller buffer sizes give
     *     fast adaptation but have of course the overhead of transmitting
     *     trees more frequently.
     *   - I can&apos;t count above 4
