 * This function is called to trigger a neutron-induced fission.
 * Multiple neutrons and photons are generated and stored
 * in a stack along with their energies, directions and 
 * emission times. In addition to the arguments above, this
 * function needs
 *      nubar:          user-specified average number of neutrons emitted 
 *                      per fission (e.g. as tabulated in the cross-section 
 *                      libraries used by the particle transport code)
 *      eng:            energy of the neutron inducing fission
