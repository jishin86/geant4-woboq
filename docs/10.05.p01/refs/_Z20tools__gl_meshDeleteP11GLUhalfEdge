 * if (eDel-&gt;Lface != eDel-&gt;Rface), we join two loops into one; the loop
 * eDel-&gt;Lface is deleted.  Otherwise, we are splitting one loop into two;
 * the newly created loop will contain eDel-&gt;Dst.  If the deletion of eDel
 * would create isolated vertices, those are deleted as well.
 *
 * This function could be implemented as two calls to __gl_meshSplice
 * plus a few calls to memFree, but this would allocate and delete
 * unnecessary vertices and faces.
