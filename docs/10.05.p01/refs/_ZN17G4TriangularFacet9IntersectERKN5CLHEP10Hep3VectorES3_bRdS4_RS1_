//
// Intersect
//
// Member function to find the next intersection when going from p in the
// direction of v.  If:
// (1) &quot;outgoing&quot; is TRUE, only consider the face if we are going out through
//     the face.
// (2) &quot;outgoing&quot; is FALSE, only consider the face if we are going in through
//     the face.
// Member functions returns TRUE if there is an intersection, FALSE otherwise.
// Sets the distance (distance along w), distFromSurface (orthogonal distance)
// and normal.
//
// Also considers intersections that happen with negative distance for small
// distances of distFromSurface = 0.5*kCarTolerance in the wrong direction.
// This is to detect kSurface without doing fA full Inside(p) in
// G4TessellatedSolid::Distance(p,v) calculation.
//
// This member function is thanks the valuable work of Rickard Holmberg.  PT.
// However, &quot;gotos&quot; are the Work of the Devil have been exorcised with
// extreme prejudice!!
//
// IMPORTANT NOTE:  These calculations are predicated on v being fA unit
// vector.  If G4TessellatedSolid or other classes call this member function
// with |v| != 1 then there will be errors.
