     *
     * This method first generates a &quot;flat&quot; event by calling generate(). The
     * particles are subsequently rotated in such a way that one of them
     * (identified by the parameter index) is biased towards the collisionAxis
     * with an exponential distribution of the form
     * \f[
     * \exp(B\cdot t)
     * \f]
     * where \f$t\f$ is the usual Mandelstam variable. The incoming momentum
     * is taken to be the momentum of particles[index] at the moment of the
     * call.
     *
     * \param sqrtS total energy in the centre of mass, in MeV
     * \param particles list of particles for which the event will be generated
     *        (modified on exit)
     * \param index index of the particle to be biased; all the other particles
     *        will follow
     * \param slope slope \f$B\f$ of the angular distribution: \f$\exp(Bt)\f$,
     *        in (GeV/c)^(-2)
