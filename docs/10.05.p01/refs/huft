   that have 16-bit pointers (e.g. PC&apos;s in the small or medium model).
   Valid extra bits are 0..13.  e == 15 is EOB (end of block), e == 16
   means that v is a literal, 16 &lt; e &lt; 32 means that v is a pointer to
   the next table, which codes e - 16 bits, and lastly e == 99 indicates
   an unused code.  If a code with e == 99 is looked up, this implies an
   error in the data. */</doc>
