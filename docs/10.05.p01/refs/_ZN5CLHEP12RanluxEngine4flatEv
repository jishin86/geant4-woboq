// Luxury level is set in the same way as the original FORTRAN routine.
//  level 0  (p=24): equivalent to the original RCARRY of Marsaglia
//           and Zaman, very long period, but fails many tests.
//  level 1  (p=48): considerable improvement in quality over level 0,
//           now passes the gap test, but still fails spectral test.
//  level 2  (p=97): passes all known tests, but theoretically still
//           defective.
//  level 3  (p=223): DEFAULT VALUE.  Any theoretically possible
//           correlations have very small chance of being observed.
//  level 4  (p=389): highest possible luxury, all 24 bits chaotic.</doc>
