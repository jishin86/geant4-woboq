<doc f='codebrowser/source/processes/hadronic/models/particle_hp/include/G4FPYBiasedLightFragmentDist.hh' l='42'>/** G4FPYBiasedLightFragmentDist is an inherited class of G4FissionProductYield
 *  that only samples the &apos;light&apos; fission fragments, defined by A \&lt; 115
 *      - This inherited class of G4FissionProductYield samples only the lighter
 *      fission fragments, defined by A \&lt; 115
 *      - This biasing was implemented because of an artifact that is introduced
 *      due to random sampling of fission fragments. Typically small fission
 *      fragments (neutrons, alphas, gammas) are sampled after the first
 *      fragment is sampled. If a heavy fragment (A \&gt;= 115) is sampled first
 *      then the resulting lighter fission fragment, after all the other
 *      particles have been removed from the available mass, will most likely
 *      land far off the neutron drip line.
 *      - This implementation reduces the probability that such an improbable
 *      nucleus will be created by first sampling the lighter fission fragment
 *      and allowing the heavy fission fragment, which has a lot more
 *      flexibility for varying neutron populations, to make up the slack.
