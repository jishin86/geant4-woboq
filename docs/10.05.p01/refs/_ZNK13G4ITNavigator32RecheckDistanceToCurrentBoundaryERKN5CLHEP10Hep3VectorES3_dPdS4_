// RecheckDistanceToCurrentBoundary
//
// Trial method for checking potential displacement for MS
// Check position aDisplacedGlobalpoint, to see whether it is in the 
// current volume (mother).
// If in mother, check distance to boundary along aNewDirection.
// If in entering daughter, check distance back to boundary. 
// NOTE:
// Can be called only after ComputeStep() is called - before ReLocation
// Deals only with current volume (and potentially entered)
// Caveats
// First VERSION: Does not consider daughter volumes if it remained in mother
//       neither for checking whether it has exited current (mother) volume,
//       nor for determining distance to exit this (mother) volume.
