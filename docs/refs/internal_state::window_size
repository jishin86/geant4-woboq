<doc f='codebrowser/source/externals/zlib/include/deflate.h' l='119'>/* Sliding window. Input bytes are read into the second half of the window,
     * and move to the first half later to keep a dictionary of at least wSize
     * bytes. With this organization, matches are limited to a distance of
     * wSize-MAX_MATCH bytes, but this ensures that IO is always
     * performed with a length multiple of the block size. Also, it limits
     * the window size to 64K, which is quite useful on MSDOS.
     * To do: use the user input buffer as sliding window.
