     *
     * Each particle is assigned a frozen momentum four-vector determined by
     * the collective cluster velocity. This is used for propagation, but not
     * for dynamics. Normal propagation is restored by calling the
     * Particle::thawPropagation() method, which should be done in
     * InteractionAvatar::postInteraction.
