     *
     * This flag is used to control pions created outside their potential well
     * in delta decay. The pion potential checks it and returns zero if it is
     * true (necessary in order to correctly enforce energy conservation). The
     * Nucleus::applyFinalState() method uses it to determine whether new
     * avatars should be generated for the particle.
