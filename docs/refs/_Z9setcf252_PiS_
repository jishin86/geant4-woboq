 * This function is called to set the data to be sampled for the neutron

 * Input
 *      nudist:
 *               0 to use the fit to the Zucker and Holden tabulated 
 *                 P(nu) distributions as a function of energy for 
 *                 U235, U238 and Pu239. Terrell for other isotopes.
 *               1 to use fits to the Zucker and Holden tabulated 
 *                 P(nu) distribution as a function of energy for 
 *                 U238 and Pu239, and a fit to the Zucker and Holden 
 *                 data as well as the Gwin, Spencer and Ingle data 
 *                 (at thermal energies) as a function of energy for 
 *                 U235. Terrell for other isotopes.
 *               2 (default) to use the fit to the Zucker and Holden 
 *                 tabulated P(nu) distributions as a function of nubar. 
 *                 The U238 fit is used for the U232, U234, U236 and 
 *                 U238 isotopes, the U235 fit for U233 and U235, the 
 *                 Pu239 fit for Pu239 and Pu241. Terrell for other 
 *                 isotopes.
