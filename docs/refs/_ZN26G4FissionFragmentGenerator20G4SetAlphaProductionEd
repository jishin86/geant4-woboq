<doc f='codebrowser/source/processes/hadronic/models/particle_hp/include/G4FissionFragmentGenerator.hh' l='149'>/** Sets the number of alpha particles produced in fission.
     *  - Usage:
     *      - if \p AlphaProduction is negative then alpha particles are sampled
     *        on a Gaussian with a mean of \p abs(AlphaProduction).
     *
     *  - Notes:
     *      - The maximum number of alpha particles that may be created is
     *        physically limited by the nucleons present in the parent nucleus.
     *        Setting the AlphaProduction too high will have unpredictable
     *        results on the sampling of the fission products.
