// REFERENCE (rather than DECLARE) when the physics list if it is part
// of a static library.  No need to include the header (DECLARE needs this
// to build the code), we just need to make a reference in order to pull
// the compilation unit static variable from the library and cause it
// to be initialized (and thus self-register)

// this is _very_ much complicated because of the templating of these lists</doc>
