 *     a few macros for the inner loops of the fill code where
 *     performance considerations don&apos;t allow a procedure call.
 *
 *     Evaluate the given edge at the given scanline.
 *     If the edge has expired, then we leave it and fix up
 *     the active edge table; otherwise, we increment the
 *     x value to be ready for the next scanline.
 *     The winding number rule is in effect, so we must notify
 *     the caller when the edge has been removed so he
 *     can reorder the Winding Active Edge Table.
