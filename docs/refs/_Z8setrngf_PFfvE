 * This function is called to set the data to be sampled for the 
 * (a) Cf252 spontaneous fission number distribution, and 
 * (b) Cf252 spontaneous fission neutron energy spectrum
 * Input
 *      ndist:
 *              0 (default) to sample the number of neutrons from the 
 *                tabulated data measured by Spencer
 *              1 to sample the number of neutrons from Boldeman&apos;s data
 *      neng:
 *              0 to sample the spontaneous fission neutron energy from 
 *                Mannhart corrected Maxwellian spectrum
 *              1 to sample the spontaneous fission neutron energy from 
 *                Madland-Nix theoretical spectrum
 *              2 to sample the spontaneous fission neutron energy from 
 *                the Froehner Watt spectrum
