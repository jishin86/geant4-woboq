<doc f='codebrowser/source/particles/management/include/G4IonTable.hh' l='319'>// It is very important for multithreaded Geant4 to keep only one copy of the
   // particle table pointer and the ion table pointer. However, we try to let 
   // each worker thread hold its own copy of the particle dictionary and the 
   // ion list. This implementation is equivalent to make the ion table thread
   // private. The two shadow ponters are used by each worker thread to copy the
   // content from the master thread.</doc>
