<doc f='codebrowser/source/processes/hadronic/models/util/include/G4HadDecayGenerator.hh' l='90'>// SPECIAL FUNCTION FOR SUBCLASSES: A subclass may implement a
  // collection of algorithms, to be switched on an event-by-event
  // basis.  This function allows the subclass to switch the &quot;active&quot;
  // algorithm before Generate() is called.
  //
  // If this function is used by the subclass, then the subclass has
  // ownership of _all_ instantiated algorithms, and should delete
  // them in its own dtor.  The subclass dtor must also call
  // UseAlgorithm(0) to set the base algorithm to a null pointer, to
  // prevent a double-delete error.</doc>
