 *  as linear regression fits from experimental data in the form: v = mx + b,
 *  where x is the incident neutron energy.
 *  \n \n Value 1: The isotope in ZZZAAA format
 *  \n Value 2: &apos;x&apos; of the linear regression fit multiplied by 10^13
 *  \n Value 3: &apos;b&apos; of the linear regression fit multiplied by 10^4
 *  \n \n See References 1, 2, 4, &amp; 5 for further information
