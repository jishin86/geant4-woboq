//
//  This is a class which stores hits collections generated at one event.
// This class is exclusively constructed by G4SDManager when the first
// hits collection of an event is passed to the manager, and this class
// object is deleted by G4RunManager when a G4Event class object is deleted.
//  Almost all public methods must be used by Geant4 kernel classes and
// the user should not invoke them. The user can use two const methods,
// GetHC() and GetNumberOfCollections() for accessing to the stored hits
// collection(s).</doc>
