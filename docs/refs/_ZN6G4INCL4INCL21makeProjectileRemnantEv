       *
       * The projectile pre-fragment is assigned an excitation energy given
       * by \f$E_\mathrm{sp}-E_\mathrm{i,A}\f$, where \f$E_\mathrm{sp}\f$ is the
       * sum of the energies of the spectator particles, and \f$E_\mathrm{i,A}\f$
       * is the sum of the smallest \f$A\f$ particle energies initially present
       * in the projectile, \f$A\f$ being the mass of the projectile
       * pre-fragment. This is equivalent to assuming that the excitation
       * energy is given by the sum of the transitions of all excited
       * projectile components to the &quot;holes&quot; left by the participants.
       *
       * This method can modify the outgoing list and adds a projectile
       * pre-fragment.
       *
       * \return the number of dynamical spectators that were merged back in
       *         the projectile
