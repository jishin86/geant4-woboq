 * mesh connectivity and topology.  It changes the mesh so that
 *	eOrg-&gt;Onext &lt;- OLD( eDst-&gt;Onext )
 *	eDst-&gt;Onext &lt;- OLD( eOrg-&gt;Onext )
 * where OLD(...) means the value before the meshSplice operation.
 *
 * This can have two effects on the vertex structure:
 *  - if eOrg-&gt;Org != eDst-&gt;Org, the two vertices are merged together
 *  - if eOrg-&gt;Org == eDst-&gt;Org, the origin is split into two vertices
 * In both cases, eDst-&gt;Org is changed and eOrg-&gt;Org is untouched.
 *
 * Similarly (and independently) for the face structure,
 *  - if eOrg-&gt;Lface == eDst-&gt;Lface, one loop is split into two
 *  - if eOrg-&gt;Lface != eDst-&gt;Lface, two distinct loops are joined into one
 * In both cases, eDst-&gt;Lface is changed and eOrg-&gt;Lface is unaffected.
 *
 * Some special cases:
 * If eDst == eOrg, the operation has no effect.
 * If eDst == eOrg-&gt;Lnext, the new face will have a single edge.
 * If eDst == eOrg-&gt;Lprev, the old face will have a single edge.
 * If eDst == eOrg-&gt;Onext, the new vertex will have a single edge.
 * If eDst == eOrg-&gt;Oprev, the old vertex will have a single edge.
